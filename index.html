        <h2 class="containerhead1">My Favorite Subject</h2>
    <p class="container2"> I like Math because it is fun and interesting as well! Math is very important in the real world because you have to use it every single day. You can have a day without math that is how significant math is. Math can be tricky and that is the best part because you get to learn from that and that makes you better. That's why I love maths!</p>
    <h2 class="containerhead2">My Favorite Activity</h2>
    <p class="container">I like soccer because it really gives you a workout for your legs because you have to use it a alot. Also I became very fast because of playing soccer because soccer improves your legs and that improves your running speed. Soccer is also fun because if your the guy who doesn't like running then you become goalie and improve your reflexes.</p>
